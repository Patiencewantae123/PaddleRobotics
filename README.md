## ü§ñ Human-Robot Interaction

#### Active Multimodal Interaction Technology - TFVT-HRI  
Active multimodal interaction allows robots to receive input from vision, speech, touch sensors, and more, making decisions and providing responses like facial expressions, movements, and sounds.

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Complex Motion Control

#### Quadruped Robot  
Through reinforcement learning, we enable the quadruped robot to walk, avoid obstacles, and overcome barriers.

## üåç Environmental Perception

Using sensors such as vision, radar, ultrasonic, and infrared, PaddleRobotics can obtain real-time environmental information, process it through data fusion techniques, and accurately assess the environmental state.

---

## üõ∞Ô∏è SLAM Localization and Navigation

By processing environmental information, we can determine passable areas and perform multi-target tracking, ensuring autonomous navigation and decision-making.
